# LaunchVU
A launch-pad for Vanderbilt students.

This project serves as a home page for Vanderbilt students, it includes links to essential--yet often hard to reach--services like
Brightspace, YES, VU Gmail, and Oracle Cloud (student employee payment portal).

Additionally, it features interaction with the Flickr API where it obtains a random photo of the Vanderbilt campus and displays it
as the background each page-load.

In the end, this project will also feature menus from the Vanderbilt website right on the home page, scraped and displayed in modals.
